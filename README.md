## 🛠️ Improvements to Consider

* Add `required` fields for validation.
* Fix minor issues like typos (`passowrd` → `password`, repeated `checked="checked"` in radio buttons).
* Include a `submit` button to complete the form.
* Style the form using CSS for a better visual appearance.
* Ensure unique `name` attributes where needed (e.g., avoid two `name="name"`).
